SwiftUI gestures break when contained in a `UIHostingController` that had a layout pass in a UIKit animated transition

## Description

When a newly instantiated `UIHostingController` is animated as part of a `UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning` within a `UINavigationController` that has a call to `view.layoutIfNeeded()` on the `UIHostingController`'s view, SwiftUI gestures stop being processed, resulting in an unresponsive application. 

Notably, gestures for embedded UIKit `UIView`s are still processed correctly; the only gestures that break are those implemented in SwiftUI, e.g. the tap gesture of a `Button`.

This issue reproduces on iOS 15 and iOS 16 Beta 6.

From poking around under the hood, it appears that when this occurs the `SwiftUI.EventBindingManager` never goes into the `isActive = true` state when the touches begin, and the `SwiftUI.UIKitGestureRecognizer` does not transition to the `ended` state on `UIGestureRecognizer.touchesEnded(â€¦)`. 

Some mitigations for this behavior are:
- Slightly repositioning the `UIHostingController`'s view on `viewDidAppear` (as seen in this commit [9f75a7a](https://github.com/erichoracek/BrokenGesturesFeedback/commit/9f75a7a9bb46d74fe6b5c40d2e8249988c6c8adc))
- Removing and re-adding the `UIHostingController`'s view to the view hierarchy, but that causes other undesirable behavior.
